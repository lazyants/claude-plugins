# `obsidian` — the shipped, primary output target

**Status: shipped this increment.** This is the only working
`output.target` value so far — `epub` resolves (Step 0d validates the enum)
but has no renderer behind it yet, and `custom` is always co-designed per
project. See [`README.md`](./README.md) for the full three-target table and
why v1 ships no generic framework above them.

Selected via `output.target: obsidian` in `profile.yml`, only ever consulted
when `output.v1_scope: assembled_book` (`SKILL.md`'s Step 0d). Renders the
assembled NodeStream (`references/assembly-and-output.md`) into an Obsidian
vault: one set of narrative pages carrying the translated book itself, plus
one entity note per frozen `canon.json` entry, cross-linked by wikilinks.
Its own knobs live under `output.adapter_config.obsidian` — currently just
`folders` (the category→folder catalog, see below); `assets/profile.example.yml`
ships the shape.

## Vault layout

Everything is written under `out_dir` (`${durable_root}/out/` by default,
or wherever `output.destination` resolves) as a `vault/` root:

- **Narrative pages** — one page per `manifest.segments[]` entry, in the
  NodeStream's `book.seg_order` reading order, each rendering that
  segment's `BlockNode`s (heading/prose/verse) with sentinels resolved:
  `⟦FNREF_N⟧` becomes an Obsidian-style footnote reference, a verse
  placeholder becomes the rendered verse text (or nothing, under
  `verse_policy.mode: skip`, per the shared assembler contract), and
  footnote definitions are appended per page. Canon terms occurring in the
  page's text are wikilinked (see below).
- **Entity notes** — one markdown file per `canon.json` `entries{}` entry
  (keyed by `source_form`, the unique original-script identity), routed into
  `vault/<folder>/` per the category→folder catalog below.

`render()` returns `{"written": [...], "kind": "vault"}` — the `"vault"`
`kind` is what tells `scripts/diff_rendered_output.py` to reduce the render
by concatenating every written file in sorted-relative-path order (each
preceded by a `--- <relpath> ---` header) before line-diffing, rather than
treating it as a single file.

## Entity-note frontmatter

Every entity note carries YAML frontmatter mirroring its `canon.json`
entry, plus two adapter-computed fields:

```yaml
---
aliases: [<original-script identity -- same value as source_form, below>]
source_form: <original-script identity, canon.json's entries{} key>
canonical_target_form: <the target-language rendering that appears in body text>
category: <open vocabulary, e.g. person/place/work/group/divine-name -- blank/absent renders as "other">
is_proper_name: <bool>
basis: established | transliterated | title | not_a_name | sense_translated
confidence: high | medium | low
source: <URI, required when basis: established>
note: <free-text human note -- singular field name, matching canon-entry.schema.json>
direction: ltr | rtl
---
```

`aliases` is always `[source_form]` — it is what lets a reader or
Obsidian's own search still find this note by its original-script identity
even though the wikilink *target* pointing at the note is the sanitized
`note_identity`, never the raw `source_form` itself (see "The wikilink
rule" below). `note` is deliberately singular — it mirrors
`canon-entry.schema.json`'s own
`note` field name exactly, not a pluralized `notes` list. `direction`
records the vault-wide writing direction implied by the project's target
language (`target.language.code`) so Obsidian renders right-to-left scripts
correctly; it is not part of `canon.json` itself, it is computed by this
adapter at render time. Entries with `basis: not_a_name` /
`is_proper_name: false` — realia, not names — still get a full entity note,
documented the same as any other entry, and are matched into body text the
same way (below); the frontmatter contract does not branch on
`is_proper_name`.

## The wikilink rule

**The asymmetry to hold onto:** the substring that actually appears in
*translated* body text is `canonical_target_form`, never `source_form` — the
wikilink's *display* text is what a reader sees, and its *target/identity*
is `note_identity`, the entity note's own sanitized, folder-qualified
relpath. `note_identity` is derived from the winning `source_form` but is a
distinct string from it, and only `note_identity` is ever safe to put
inside `[[...]]`.

- Build the matcher over the set of every entry's `canonical_target_form`
  value, **sorted longest-first**, so a longer name is never shadowed by a
  shorter one that happens to be its substring — **except** entries with
  `basis: sense_translated` (#138), which are deliberately **excluded from
  the matcher entirely**. A sense-rendering is an ordinary word by
  construction ("Hope", "Wolf"), and this unanchored, no-word-boundary
  matcher would otherwise wikilink every incidental occurrence of that word
  in the prose, not just the entity's own mentions. Such an entry still gets
  a full entity note (frontmatter, `basis` included) — only the body
  auto-linking is suppressed, erring toward the recoverable failure (a
  missing auto-link) over a false-link flood. (The pre-existing `not_a_name`
  realia case above is unaffected by this rule and stays body-matched as
  before.)
- Match within a single narrative block's text (a plain string match against
  the resolved text, never entity/NLP matching); wrap only the **first
  occurrence per block** — a name repeated three times in one paragraph
  gets exactly one wikilink, not three.
- The wikilink itself: `[[<note_identity>|<canonical_target_form>]]` — link
  target/identity is `note_identity`: the same sanitized, collision-deduped,
  **folder-qualified** relpath (e.g. `People/Ivan`, minus the `.md`
  extension) that the entity-note-writing loop resolves for that entry's
  actual filename, both resolved from the one lookup up front so a link can
  never point at a note the writer doesn't actually emit under that exact
  name. This is deliberately **not** `source_form`: a raw `source_form`
  containing path-like text (`../`, a leading separator, control bytes)
  would otherwise leak straight into a wikilink target, and even a
  "safe-looking" bare stem is not guaranteed unique once two entries in
  *different* folders sanitize to the same name — folder-qualification is
  what keeps those apart. `source_form` still travels with the note, just
  never as the link target: it lives in the note's own `source_form`
  frontmatter field and its `aliases` entry (see "Entity-note frontmatter"
  above), so a reader or Obsidian's own search can still find the note by
  its original-script identity. Display text is `canonical_target_form` (so
  the reader sees the actual translated name in context, not the original
  script or the sanitized filename).
- `canonical_target_form` is **not** guaranteed unique across entries (two
  different `source_form`s can transliterate to the same target-language
  string). The documented tiebreak when more than one entry shares a
  `canonical_target_form`: prefer the entry with the shortest `source_form`,
  then break any remaining tie lexicographically by `source_form` — this
  decides which entry's `note_identity` the shared display text ends up
  linking to. This is the one arbitrary-but-fixed rule that keeps the
  matcher deterministic; the plugin's own tests pin this exact ordering.

## Backlinks are the occurrence index — for free

Obsidian's native backlinks panel on every entity note already lists every
narrative page that links to it — that **is** the occurrence index. No
separate index file is built, and `build_name_manifest.py` (the reference
project's own hand-rolled occurrence-gathering script) is deliberately not
ported; backlinks replace it entirely. `output.index.enabled` (see
`references/assembly-and-output.md`) governs a *different*, still-later-phase
concept — a generated standalone index page — and stays irrelevant to this
adapter's own occurrence tracking. A depth-1 MOC (map-of-content) stub
listing every category folder is a reasonable, proportional addition; a
deeper generated index is explicitly out of scope here.

### 1.8.0+ — source-anchored `## Mentions` section, ON BY DEFAULT since 1.10.0

Native backlinks are only as complete as the **inline linker**, which matches
one `canonical_target_form` string against translated prose — so a variant
target rendering gets no backlink (#206) and two source forms sharing a target
collapse to one owner (#207-a). `output.adapter_config.obsidian.mentions_section.enabled`
adds an authoritative **source-anchored** occurrence index: a `## Mentions`
section in each entity note, wrapped in reserved `<!-- lt:mentions:begin/end -->`
markers, listing the segment notes where the entity's *source* forms occur (per
`occ_index`), independent of how the target surface varies. This is the
`build_name_manifest.py` model ported at last, and it supersedes "native
backlinks are the occurrence index." `sense_translated` proper names — which
the inline linker deliberately never auto-links — DO get Mentions here (source
anchoring links them safely), and (1.10.0, #240) a `sense_translated` entry
sharing a `canonical_target_form` with a narrative entry now correctly
contributes to that target's collision count even though it can never win the
inline-link tiebreak itself — see "Collision de-linking" below.

**ON BY DEFAULT (1.10.0+):** an absent `mentions_section` block, or an
absent `enabled` key within a present block, resolves to enabled for
`output.target: obsidian`; set `enabled: false` explicitly to opt out
(byte-identical to pre-1.10.0 output). `enabled` must be a **boolean**
when present — a literal `enabled: null` (or `mentions_section: null`) is
schema-invalid (`profile.schema.json` declares both as non-nullable) and
is **rejected by `profile_validate.py`** before it ever reaches the
runtime predicate. Omit the key (or the whole block) to get the
default-on behavior through the normal, schema-valid path — `null` is not
a supported way to spell it. (The three runtime predicates' own `is not
False` check tolerates `None` defensively, purely as a fallback for a
profile dict constructed outside the normal Step 0 validation path; it is
not evidence that a schema-valid profile can carry `enabled: null`.)
Through 1.9.x this was opt-in (default false) — see the CHANGELOG for the
migration note (a rendered vault holding an accepted
`diff_rendered_output.py` baseline needs one operator `--accept-baseline`
re-accept once this lands, since `render_obsidian.py`'s own bytes changed;
converged segments are never re-translated by this flip).
The advisory `validate_backlinks.py` W9 gate (non-blocking) reports coverage;
the aggregated `output.index` person-index page + `index_scope` routing
remain a later phase.

**Collision de-linking is part of the same effective-enabled predicate.**
When two canon entries share one `canonical_target_form`, the inline linker's
own shortest-source-form tiebreak (documented above) silently drops the
losing entry's inline link; with Mentions section active, BOTH entries are
de-linked instead — the `## Mentions` section is what makes either entity's
occurrences discoverable once the ambiguous inline link is removed.

## Category→folder catalog — presets are EXAMPLES, not an enum

`category` is genuinely **open vocabulary** — `canon-entry.schema.json`
documents it as free-form per-project text, not a fixed schema enum, because
the right catalog differs per work (a mythology-heavy text needs
`divine-name`; a political history needs `institution`; many projects need
neither). This adapter routes each entity note into `vault/<folder>/` using
the profile's own `output.adapter_config.obsidian.folders` map as a
**lookup table only** (`category → folder`); a category absent from that
map, blank/absent on the entry itself, or simply unmapped, routes to
`vault/other/` **unconditionally** — never as the category string itself
(see "Security" below).

The categories below are **illustrative starting presets**, not a hardcoded
enum this adapter switches on — copy, rename, or drop any of them per
project:

| Example `category` | Example folder |
|---|---|
| `person` | `People` |
| `place` | `Places` |
| `work` | `Works` |
| `group` | `Groups` |
| `divine-name` | `Divine Names` |

```yaml
output:
  adapter_config:
    obsidian:
      folders:
        person: People
        place: Places
        work: Works
        group: Groups
        divine-name: "Divine Names"
        # any other project-specific category the co-designed canon uses;
        # absent-or-blank category always routes to "other"
```

## Security: only mapped folder VALUES ever reach a filesystem path

`category` itself is used **exclusively as a dict-lookup key** into
`output.adapter_config.obsidian.folders` — it is never joined into a path,
full stop, no matter how ASCII-safe or path-segment-looking a given
category string happens to be. Absent, blank, or unmapped all resolve to
`vault/other/` **unconditionally** — there is no fallback where a
"safe-looking" unmapped category gets used raw as its own folder name.

The only strings that ever reach a path join are the **folder VALUES this
project's own profile declares** in `folders` (plus the fixed literal
`other`). Before any declared folder value is used as a path segment, this
adapter enforces a **positive allow-list**, `^[A-Za-z0-9 _-]+$`, and rejects
`.`/`..`/empty/a leading path separator. A denylist is not sufficient here
(a denylist rejecting `/` or `..` still lets through other shell/path
metacharacters it didn't anticipate — see the repo's own identifier→path
allow-list precedent). This means the untrusted-input boundary this
allow-list actually defends is the profile's own `folders` map — not
`category`, which never reaches the join at all.

Note *filenames*, derived from each entry's `source_form`, get the same
fail-closed, allow-list-first posture applied to whatever filesystem-unsafe
characters a raw name could contain (path separators, `..`, control/NUL
bytes, a leading separator) — rejected/stripped before the file is written,
never patched up after the fact with a denylist of specific bad substrings.
Unlike `category`/`folders` (an English-ish open vocabulary the profile
declares), `source_form` is often non-ASCII source-script text (Cyrillic,
etc.) by design — see `SKILL.md`'s English-only-identifiers rule, which
governs code identifiers, not this kind of data-derived filename — so the
filename sanitizer's allowed character set is necessarily wider than
`category`'s, while holding the same "positive allow-list, reject
traversal/separators before any join" discipline.
