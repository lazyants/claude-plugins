"""Every `file.ext:NNN` citation in the newest CHANGELOG entry must still point
at what it claims to point at.

WHY THIS EXISTS, and why two weaker versions of it did not work. Release notes
here cite source by line number, and line numbers move whenever anything above
them is edited. Five review rounds of 1.20.0 found broken citations.

The first checker verified only that line NNN *exists* in a file of at least
NNN lines. That cannot fail on drift -- a citation that slides nine rows still
points at a line that exists -- so it shared its blind spot with the defect and
reported clean for three rounds while eight citations pointed at unrelated
code. The cause was a docstring edit made in four scripts at once, which
inserted nine lines above most of the cited sites.

The second checker matched a single anchor string anywhere inside the cited
range. Better, but still defeatable, and it was defeated: inserting comment
lines *inside* a wide range pushed the code the claim is about past the range's
end while the anchor sat safely near the start, and the check passed.

So anchors are a LIST, and every one must be present. For a range, declare
enough of them to span the claim -- typically its first and last load-bearing
line, plus whatever the claim is actually ABOUT in between.

WHAT THIS STILL DOES NOT CATCH, stated because two earlier versions of this
docstring claimed more than the code delivered. Anchors detect content leaving
a range; they do not detect content CHANGING inside it. `fatal(` becoming
`print(` keeps every anchor in range, and so does refactoring a call into a
payload built in-range and dispatched after it. Anchoring the load-bearing
tokens of the claim narrows that -- which is why `fatal(` is anchored rather
than only the condition guarding it -- but a semantic mutant that preserves
every anchored token passes. This checks that a citation still POINTS at its
claim, not that the claim is still TRUE.

MAINTENANCE CONTRACT. This covers the NEWEST entry only, since that is the one
under active edit. Adding a citation means adding its anchors here; the test
fails on a citation with no anchors and on anchors no citation uses, so neither
half can silently rot. When a new version entry lands, this map is rewritten
for it -- the failure that forces that is the point, not an annoyance."""
